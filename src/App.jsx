    <h1>STORY ABOUT MYSELF</h1>
  <p>My name is Olaide Abiola Fuad, i am nigerian. i love technology alot and that is why i engage alot in the field. i started my career in tech as an hardware engineer and graphic designer. where i learnt basic troubleshooting techniques, formatting, partitioning and software installation and others. i learnt graphic designing with the use of coreldraw and photoshop. during my apprenticeship i wasn't too good at using this graphic design software or i would rather say my creative mind wasn't sharpen enough.
  and this made me weiry alot to learn more so i started learning on my own by watching tutorials on what i've known and do not, i learnt the best design skills and tips even though i couldn't learn all of this in a year of my apprenticechip but i learnt continuously while studying in the higher institution because i gained admission after a year of completing my apprenticeship. i studied computer science, during my year of study in school learnt alot on my own with the help of online resources which helped me boost my skill in web development, i also joined the GDSC(google developer student club) and online bootcamp and today i am happy about my growth.
